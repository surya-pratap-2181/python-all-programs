''' 
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.
'''
a = int(input("enter first no. "))
b = int(input("enter first no. "))
print(a//b)
print(float(a/b))
